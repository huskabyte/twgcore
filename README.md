# [Abandoned] "Core" mod for my old Minecraft server
 
Written and maintained solely by me, this was part of the Minecraft Server project which I originally launched 6 years ago and finally saw to release over the quarantine. Since it was such a long project, the team that ran it was quite tiny, and Minecraft received a full engine rewrite, however, I wasn't able to keep up with the versions and the project ended up dying after amassing over a hundred active players at a point.

It's always been one of my dreams to run a Minecraft server free for the public with no paywalls for content, and I hope I can achieve that dream in the future. Minecraft is such a cool space to collaborate and form really close connections. The freedom to do anything - from playing a minigame with friends to creating large empires in Survival mode - I've never seen anything else quite like it.
